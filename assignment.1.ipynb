        "1. **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**:\n",
        "   - **Definition**: AI is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction.\n",
        "   - **Example**: A chatbot that can understand and respond to customer queries, such as Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Machine Learning (ML)**:\n",
        "   - **Definition**: ML is a subset of AI that involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable a computer to improve its performance on a specific task through experience (data) without being explicitly programmed.\n",
        "   - **Example**: An email spam filter that learns to classify emails as spam or not based on previous emails labeled by users.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Deep Learning (DL)**:\n",
        "   - **Definition**: DL is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks) to analyze various factors of data. DL is especially powerful for tasks such as image and speech recognition.\n",
        "   - **Example**: A deep learning model used in autonomous vehicles to identify objects like pedestrians, cars, and traffic signs.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Q2: What is supervised learning? List some examples of supervised learning.\n",
        "- **Definition**: Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data. The input data is paired with the correct output, and the model learns to map the inputs to the outputs.\n",
        "- **Examples**:\n",
        "  - Regression: Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, etc.\n",
        "  - Classification: Email spam detection, where emails are labeled as 'spam' or 'not spam'.\n",
        "  - Object recognition in images: Identifying objects in a photo with labeled examples of each object.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Q3: What is unsupervised learning? List some examples of unsupervised learning.\n",
        "- **Definition**: Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on unlabeled data. The model tries to learn the patterns and the structure from the input data without any explicit outputs provided.\n",
        "- **Examples**:\n",
        "  - Clustering: Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior without predefined categories.\n",
        "  - Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of features in a dataset while retaining important information, such as using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).\n",
        "  - Anomaly detection: Identifying unusual data points within a dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Q4: What is the difference between AI, ML, DL, and DS?\n",
        "- **AI (Artificial Intelligence)**: The broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider “smart.”\n",
        "- **ML (Machine Learning)**: A subset of AI that involves the use of algorithms to allow computers to learn from and make decisions based on data.\n",
        "- **DL (Deep Learning)**: A subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers to analyze various data representations.\n",
