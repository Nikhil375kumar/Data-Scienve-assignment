        "**Overfitting**:\n",
        "- **Definition**: Overfitting occurs when a model learns the details and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new data. It essentially means the model is too complex and captures the noise along with the underlying pattern.\n",

        "- **Mitigation**:\n",
        "  - Simplify the model by reducing the number of parameters.\n",
        "  - Use cross-validation techniques like k-fold cross-validation.\n",

        "5. **Data Augmentation**: Increase the size and diversity of the training data by creating modified versions of existing data points.\n",
        "6. **Early Stopping**: Monitor performance on a validation set and stop training when performance starts to degrade.\n",
        "7. **Dropout**: Randomly drop units and their connections during training in neural networks to prevent units from co-adapting too much.\n",
        "8. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine predictions from multiple models using techniques like bagging (e.g., Random Forest) and boosting (e.g., Gradient Boosting).\n",
